# Deep-Neural-Network-for-Cut-Mark-Classification
Neural Networks are highly powerful and versatile algorithms that can be trained to complex and large datasets. Here lies the code and details used to design a Neural Network that differentiates anthropic butchery traces from naturally produced trampling damage on bones
